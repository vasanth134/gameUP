# GameUP - Gamified Child Task Tracker

A modern, gamified task management system designed to make household chores and responsibilities fun for families. Parents can assign tasks to their children, track progress, and reward completion with XP points.

## üéØ Project Overview

GameUP transforms mundane household tasks into an engaging game-like experience. Children earn XP points for completing tasks, while parents can easily assign, monitor, and review submissions. The platform includes real-time notifications, progress tracking, and a comprehensive dashboard for both parents and children.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling task submission files
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling and validation

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication state
- **Routing**: React Router for SPA navigation
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with reusable elements

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Unified table supporting both parents and children with role-based access

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gameUP
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   cd task-tracker-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_NAME=task_tracker
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_PORT=5432
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   # Create PostgreSQL database
   createdb task_tracker
   
   # Run initialization script
   psql -d task_tracker -f init.sql
   ```

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd ../gamified-task-frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Sample Accounts
The database includes pre-configured test accounts:

**Parent Account:**
- Email: parent@test.com
- Password: password123

**Child Account:**
- Email: child@test.com
- Password: password123

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach

### Backend Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between routes, controllers, and database logic
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
3. **Validation**: Input validation at multiple levels (route, controller, database)
4. **Security**: JWT authentication, password hashing, and SQL injection prevention
5. **Database Design**: Normalized schema with proper foreign key relationships

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Component-Based**: Reusable UI components with TypeScript interfaces
2. **Context Management**: Centralized authentication state with React Context
3. **Protected Routing**: Authentication guards for secure navigation
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for better developer experience

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **TypeScript**: Chosen for better type safety and developer experience
2. **PostgreSQL**: Selected for robust relational data handling and ACID compliance
3. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication for scalability
4. **React Context**: Simple state management solution for this application size
5. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent styling

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Testing
The backend includes comprehensive error handling and validation:

## üöÄ Deployment Considerations

### Environment Setup
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Configure database connection pooling for production
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Enable HTTPS in production

### Database Migration
- The `init.sql` file handles table creation and sample data
- Consider using migration tools for production deployments
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
